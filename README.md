## Purpose
* Prepare for a freelance project ['Jose's Photograph Portfolio'](https://joseheart8.netlify.app/)

### Plans of SPA pages for the freelance project and this project
**1. the original plan for the project**

üëç the owner can manage photos by himself after we deply the portfolio website<br/>
üëé It costs maintenance fee„ÄÄbecause the data transportation restliction of Firebase storage free plan is not enough as a photogragh portfolio<br />

**2. acctual SPA pages for the project**

üëç Low cost<br/>
üëé It is impossible to update the portfolio photo data by himself<br />
**3. SPA pages for this project**

I decided to create this website as a personal photo album.
## Challenging parts
* Implementation of public page and private page depending on users login status: I refered [this react router page](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/examples/auth) and [this example](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/examples/auth?file=src/App.tsx)
* Use new tools such as axios and useForm hook: I wrote aricles about them respectively ([Comparison between fetch and axios
](https://dev.to/lada496/comparison-between-fetch-and-axios-4np2), [Form management with useForm (error messaging and data validation)](https://dev.to/lada496/form-management-with-useform-error-messaging-and-data-validation-711))
